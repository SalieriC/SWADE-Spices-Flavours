# SWADE Spices & Flavours
A module to configure visuals and various other elements in the SWADE System on Foundry VTT. Most features affect the community sheet only. The ultimate goal is to create a full customisation suite for the SWADE community sheet.

## Current Features
Currently the module has the following features (almost all of them are optional):
- Option to configure a custom background image for the community sheets.
- Option to display a custom Logo to the PC sheet.
- Option to display Skill icons on the Sheets.
- Option to show character artwork on the top of the PC sheet.
- Option to center the character name within its field.
- Option to change the background, border and text colour of the sheets headers and tabs.
- Option to change the background and text colour of the PC sheets item colums background and text.
- Option to change the border radius of the sheets headers and tabs individually (to give it a sharp or round edge).
- Colour Picker to change the scrollbar colours (does not affect those in currently edited fields).
- Colour Picker to change the status checkbox colours. (The checkmark currently cannot be edited.)
- Option to change the Benny front and back image. If changed, the Benny will also be shown on the official sheet.
- More visible toggle for Active Effects (hopefully for colour blind people as well).
- Option to make the sheets background image the chat message background.
- Option to give whispered chat messages a border colour, the border is 3 pixels wide and transparent (invisible) by default.
- Option to change the active tab text colour
- Option to change the Quick Access background colour.
- Option to change the background colour of every second (even) Skill. This colour is also used for Gear (Inventory tab), Edges and Hindrances (both in the Edges tab).
- Option to change the passive (non-selected) AB tab background colour. Active and hovered over tabs use the colour of the general tabs. The text colour is inherited from the passive and active general tabs respectively.
