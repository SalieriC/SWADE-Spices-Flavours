- Option to display Skill icons on the Sheets.
- Option to show character artwork on the top of the PC sheet.

## Planned Features
You can take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Spices-Flavours/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to see our unreleased but planned features.

## Dependencies
Obviously you need a [SWADE system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/swade/) world to make any use of the module. You also need [lib - Color Settings](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/colorsettings/) activated in your world (you will be notified about it).
