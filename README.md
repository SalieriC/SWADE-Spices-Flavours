# SWADE Spices & Flavours
A simple module to configure some stuff in the SWADE System on Foundry VTT. Most Features affect the community sheet only.

## Current Features
Currently the module has the following features (almost all of them are optional):
- Option to configure a custom background image for the community sheets.
- Option to display a custom Logo to the PC sheet.
- Option to display Skill icons on the Sheets.
- Option to show character artwork on the top of the PC sheet.
- Option to center the character name within its field.
- Option to change the background and text colour of the sheets headers and tabs.
- Option to change the background and text colour of the PC sheets item colums background and text.
- Colour Picker to change the status checkbox colours. (The checkmark currently cannot be edited.)
- Option to change the Benny front and back image. If changed, the Benny will also be shown on the official sheet.
