# SWADE Spices & Flavours
A simple module to configure some stuff in the SWADE System on Foundry VTT. Please note: Due to the restrictions from PEG, we are unable to add options to change the appearance of the official sheet. Also because of PEGs restrictions we cannot offer an option to change the Benny image (if Dice So Nice! is enabled). We hope that PEG will reconsider their decision on not allowing to change the Benny image.

## Current Features
Currently the module has the following features (almost all of them are optional):
- Option to configure a custom background image for the community sheet.
- Option to display a custom Logo to the PC sheet.
- Option to display Skill icons on the Sheets.
- Option to show character artwork on the top of the sheet.
- Option to center the character name within its field.
- Option to change the background and text colour of the sheets headers and tabs.
- Option to change the background and text colour of the PC sheets item colums background and text.

## Planned Features
You can take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Spices-Flavours/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to see our unreleased but planned features.
